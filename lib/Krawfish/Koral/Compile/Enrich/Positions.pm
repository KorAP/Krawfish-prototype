# TODO:
#   Enrich each document in the result set with
#   information where in the document a hit occurs.
#   The positions should be normalized by the length
#   of the document.
#   Result may be like:
#   positions: [
#     2.4,
#     8.91,
#     8.92,
#     ...
#     99.5
#   ]
#   where each point is a position in a range of 0-100.
#   This is useful to create ConcordancePlots, see
