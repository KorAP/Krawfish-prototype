# TODO:
#   Depending on the overhead, either mergesort the results
#   from the node, use a heap structure (similar to the node/sort)
#   or fetch the data completely and sort the results in a cascade

# TODO:
#  Sort is currently limited to sorting for searching.
#  It should also be able to sort groups by columns.
