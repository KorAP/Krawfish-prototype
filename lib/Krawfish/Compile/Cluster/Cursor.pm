# A cursor will enrich the search results by adding a signature
# of the latest returned match in sorted scenarios. When
# mirroring this counter, the search will restart at this point
# in the sorting by adding this value as the top-border in
# the priority-queue of the segments (meaning this needs to
# be enabled in the priority queues).
# Creating the cursor requires an enriching strategy.
# Supporting cursor in search requires enabling a top-border in
# the priority queue.
