        Krawfish is a testbed search backend for KorAP,
        to implement design concepts for Kanalito and Krill
        (especially distribution, queries, query optimization, Web API)
        and some alternative features, like multiple tokenizations.
        Krawfish is based on Krill and therefore heavily inspired by
        Lucene and Lucy.

        Currently Krawfish supports ...
