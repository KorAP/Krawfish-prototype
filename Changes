        Krawfish is a simple testbed search backend for KorAP,
        to test some design concepts for Krill
        (especially queries, query deserialization, Web API)
        and some alternative features, like multiple tokenizations.
        Krawfish is based on Krill and therefore heavily inspired by
        Lucene and Lucy.
