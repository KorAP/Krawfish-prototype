The Krawfish Prototype is a testbed search backend for KorAP,
to implement design concepts both for Kanalito and Krill.

Krawfish focusses on
- Patterns for distribution
  (data aggregation, sorting, grouping ...)
- Implementation of a forward index
- Normalization and optimization of complex queries
- Implementation of experimental features

The segment handling of Krawfish is based on Krill and therefore
heavily inspired by Lucene and Lucy.
