Krawfish is a testbed search backend for KorAP,
to implement design concepts both for Kanalito and Krill
The segment handling of Krawfish is based on Krill and
therefore heavily inspired by Lucene and Lucy.

Krawfish focusses on
- Patterns for distribution
  (aggregation, sorting ...)
- Implementation of a forward index
- Normalization and optimization of complex queries
- Implementation of experimental queries
